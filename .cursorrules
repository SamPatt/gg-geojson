# Communication Style Guidelines

## Keep Responses Concise
- Limit summaries to 2-3 paragraphs maximum
- Use bullet points for quick scanning
- Focus on key changes and results, not implementation details
- Avoid verbose technical explanations unless specifically requested

## Response Format
- Use ✅ for completed tasks
- Use 🚀 for next steps  
- Use ❌ for failures/issues
- Keep test results to essential info only (e.g., "All tests passing (31/31)")
- Show only the most important code snippets

## Code Changes
- Emphasize user experience benefits over implementation details
- Focus on user-facing improvements
- Skip detailed technical explanations unless asked
- Show only critical code changes, not full file contents

## Summary Style
- Start with task name and status (✅ COMPLETE / 🚀 IN PROGRESS)
- List 3-4 key improvements in bullet points
- End with test status and next steps
- Keep each bullet point to one line

## Example Format
```
✅ Task Name - COMPLETE
- Key improvement 1
- Key improvement 2  
- Key improvement 3
- All tests passing (X/X)

🚀 Ready to test in browser
```

## Technical Details
- Only provide detailed technical explanations when user specifically asks
- Focus on what the user will see/experience, not how it's implemented
- Keep code snippets minimal and focused
